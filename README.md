# [Wiki](https://github.com/JorgeyGari/svt_a1/wiki)
Since documentation plays a key role in this assignment, we are keeping a wiki detailing the development process. A [list of the required methods](https://github.com/JorgeyGari/svt_a1/wiki#list-of-methods) can also be found there.

# [Project](https://github.com/users/JorgeyGari/projects/5)
We have created an issue corresponding to each method and are keeping track of its progress, divided into five stages: Todo, Tests, Implementation, Documentation and Done. Each status is described in the project, and you can self-assign any method you want to start working on.
